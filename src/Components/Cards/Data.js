      "As a former NCAA Qualifying Athlete, â€‹i realized everyone have something they need to work on, especially when you are an athlete. But that is not necessary a bad thing, its just show that you have room to keep growing as a person as well as becoming an outstanding athlete. My job is to help you through this journey using my knowledge as well as your determination for us to make it to that next level If this pertains to you, then i would recommend the athletic boot camp. Here we will spend time focusing on what needs changing or adjusting so that will reach your goal in the safest and fastest way possible."

      "I know working out can be tough especially when you are doing it alone or with a Personal trainer. Thats why i recommend this class because working out with a group is fun easier, and having a group of people with the same goal working out together, give out good energy that make you work harder without realizing it. I have a group training for Athletes and non athletes, which ever you are, i promise your goal is our mission. Non athletes group training and Atheltes group training, we offer both."
